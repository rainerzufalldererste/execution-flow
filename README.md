# execution-flow

### What is execution-flow?
execution-flow is a CPU performance analysis tool based on LLVM & llvm-mca that bundles simulated CPU Resource Usage Information from LLVM in a nice per-instruction datastructure. execution-flow includes a tool that turns this analysis into a pretty html file, as the command-line interface of `llvm-mca` sadly limits its usefulness a bit.
